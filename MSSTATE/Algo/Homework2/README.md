The next function focuses on making a 5x5 array with random numbers.
The while loop function shows how a while loop works in python.
The findmax function finds a random max number between 1-20 for 20 integers.
The plot functions defines p, then finds the root of the function, then plots the function, then call the Newton Horner methond to compare.
The main fuction calls all the above functions and executes them.
